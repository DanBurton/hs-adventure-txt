#hs-adventure-txt
**Simple text adventure engine in Haskell**

This is a simple implementation of the Cadventure-txt format:
http://github.com/tech-no-crat/Cadventure-txt

And by simple, I mean *very* simple.
Currently, comments are not supported, = is not supported,
and whitespace has to be very precise.

Patches are welcome;
I may or may not beef up my Parsec skills
and clean up the code a bit.
